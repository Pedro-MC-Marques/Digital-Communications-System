# Digital-Communications-System

Welcome to the repository for our Digital Communication System project, developed during the first semester of our Telecommunications course.

## Project Overview

We tackled the challenges of transmitting signals in noisy and interference-prone environments by utilizing advanced modulation and coding techniques. Our simulator, built in Octave, processes sinusoidal and speech signalsâ€”encoding, transmitting, and decoding them with high precision.

## Results

Our findings demonstrate that the implementation of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), Manchester encoding, and the Hamming (7,4) code effectively preserves signal integrity and corrects errors. This work significantly enhances the understanding and improvement of digital communications, offering a robust and efficient system for future telecommunications applications.

## Conclusions

- **Advanced Techniques are Crucial**: Employing sophisticated modulation and coding methods is essential for efficient signal transmission in noisy conditions.
- **Effective Simulation**: The Octave-based simulator proved to be a powerful tool for testing and validating different coding techniques.
- **Error Correction Achieved**: The combination of PCM, Manchester encoding, and the Hamming (7,4) code successfully maintained signal integrity and corrected errors.
